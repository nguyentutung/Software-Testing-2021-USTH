# Ex3.5: Develop JUnit tests for the BoundedQueue class. A compilable version is available on the book website in the file BoundedQueue.java. Make sure your tests check every method, but we will not evaluate the quality of your test designs and do not expect you to satisfy any test criteria. Turn in a printout of your JUnit tests and either a printout or a screen shot showing the results of each test.

The assertion only checks a small part of the final state (the first element in the list).If a test causes a fault to infect, and then propagate to another part of the final state, so that the failure will not be checked and revealed. The test oracle needs to look at the entire list.
