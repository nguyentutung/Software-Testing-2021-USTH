# Exercise 8.1.6
## Question
In Section 8.1.6, we introduced the example p = (a ∨ b) ∧ c, and provided an extended version of the clause using program variables. Then we give a specific value that satisfies the PC. We also give the truth value that satisfies CC. Find a value that satisfies CC for a given program variable; that is, refine the abstract test into concrete test values.
